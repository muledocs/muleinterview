However, it is now discouraged due to security concerns.",
    "point3": "<strong>Client Credentials Grant:</strong><br><strong>Use Case:</strong> Used for machine-to-machine communication where no user is involved.

    "point4": "<strong>Resource Owner Password Credentials (ROPC) Grant:</strong><br><strong>Use Case:</strong> Allows the client to directly request an access token by providing the user's username and password.<br><strong>Best For:</strong> Trusted applications where the user can safely share their credentials (e.g., legacy systems). This is not recommended for modern apps due to security risks.",
